# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game written in javascript. 
A project for one of my courses in my first year at university('20-'21).

## Idea of the game:
Website where you can play minesweeper. You left-click to uncover a square, and right-click to flag a certain square. You win if you uncover each square without uncovering a bomb.  

## What i learned from this project:
- My first encounter with JS, so I learned a lot of JS semantics.
- Learned a bit of CSS to make it display prettier.
- Further developed my HTML skills, although not a lot.
